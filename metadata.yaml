description: "The American Claimant is an 1892 novel by American humorist and writer\
  \ Mark Twain. Twain wrote the novel with the help of phonographic dictation, the\
  \ first author (according to Twain himself) to do so. This was also (according to\
  \ Twain) an attempt to write a book without mention of the weather, the first of\
  \ its kind in fictitious literature. Indeed, all the weather is contained in an\
  \ appendix, at the back of the book, which the reader is encouraged to turn to from\
  \ time to time.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
